## Description 

The *FroImPro Toolbox* is a collection of MATLAB functions that solve a wide variety of video and image processing problems. Each problem is represented as an optimization problem based on the Frobenius norm.

This toolbox addresses the following applications of image and video processing:

* **Application 1:** Construction of filters to remove noise from an image.
  
* **Application 2:** Non-negative matrix factorization applied to image reconstruction.
  
* **Application 3:** Low-rank matrix approximation using the BRP algorithm and its application to image compression and denoising.
  
* **Application 4:** GoDec algorithm applied to variation detection in an image dataset.
  
* **Application 5:** K-SVD algorithm applied to image reconstruction with missing pixels.
  
This repository contains the following information:

* Folder *mlbtx_file* contains the file with extension .mlbtx for installation of *FroImPro Toolbox* in MATLAB. 

* Folder *matlab_functions* contains the MATLAB code for the functions of the *FroImPro Toolbox*.

* Folder *examples*  contains examples of each of the applications described above

* File *Manual_FroImPro_Español.pdf*  provides a manual in Spanish explaining how to use every function of the *FroImPro Toolbox*.
